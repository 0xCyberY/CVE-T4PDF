|    Name    |  Description  |    PoC    |
| :----------: | :------: | :-----: |
| CVE-2022-32241 | When a user opens manipulated Portable Document Format (.pdf, PDFView.x3d) files received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer, the application crashes and becomes temporarily unavailable to the user until restart of the application. | |
| CVE-2022-31041 | Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Open Forms supports file uploads as one of the form field types. These fields can be configured to allow only certain file extensions to be uploaded by end users (e.g. only PDF / Excel / ...). The input validation of uploaded files is insufficient in versions prior to 1.0.9 and 1.1.1. Users could alter or strip file extensions to bypass this validation. This results in files being uploaded to the server that are of a different file type than indicated by the file name extension. These files may be downloaded (manually or automatically) by staff and/or other applications for further processing. Malicious files can therefore find their way into internal/trusted networks. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, an API gateway or intrusion detection solution in front of open-forms may be able to scan for and block malicious content before it reaches the Open Forms application. | |
| CVE-2022-30775 | xpdf 4.04 allocates excessive memory when presented with crafted input. This can be triggered by (for example) sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftoppm binary. It is most easily reproduced with the DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=afl-clang-fast++ option. | |

| CVE-2022-28368 | Dompdf 1.2.1 allows remote code execution via a .php file in the src:url field of an @font-face Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) statement (within an HTML input file). | |
| CVE-2022-28345 | The Signal app before 5.34 for iOS allows URI spoofing via RTLO injection. It incorrectly renders RTLO encoded URLs beginning with a non-breaking space, when there is a hash character in the URL. This technique allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send legitimate looking links, appearing to be any website URL, by abusing the non-http/non-https automatic rendering of URLs. An attacker can spoof, for example, example.com, and masquerade any URL with a malicious destination. An attacker requires a subdomain such as gepj, txt, fdp, or xcod, which would appear backwards as jpeg, txt, pdf, and docx respectively. | |
